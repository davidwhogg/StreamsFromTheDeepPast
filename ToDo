streams project to-do list
--------------------------

KVJ learn to use CVS.

Write new fake_catalog which takes, as input, the output of
ex_max_proj.

Fully test ex_max_proj.

Understand and remove multiples correctly from HIPPARCOS catalog.

Write sample selection section for the paper.

Show that the code gets the right answer when we make a fake catalog
with our model and fit to that fake catalog.

Show that the code is not fooled or screwed-up by spatial gradients of
velocity (ie, non isotropic distributions of stars in the velocity
clumps).

Get literature radial velocities.

Check radial velocity predictions.

Include radial velocities explicitly?

Measure the masses of the clumps using only the lower main sequence
(ie, long-lived stars).

Investigate whether HIPPARCOS selection can create spurious age
effects in velocity components.

Repeat analysis with only lower main sequence, only upper main
sequence, only giants to check population differences in the clumps.

Compute expected timescale for velocity streams to disperse.

Get FAME numbers of stars in various limits.

Make weighted C-M diagrams.
