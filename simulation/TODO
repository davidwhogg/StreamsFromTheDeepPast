Make clip showing not *closest* stream but stream with largest single-star displacement (by the end of the time).


run it backwards for a variable number of steps then run it forwards for twice that number (but keep the stars that you have run backwards). do same for perturber.

there is a big problem with numerical integration, so rewind and go back to the beginning without taking into account the perturber at all, then email hogg.




Make all numbers global variables

perturber is moving too quickly
