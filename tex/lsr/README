    [from Brad:]

    Dear David:

    Enclosed please find the referee's report on your submission to
    the ApJ entitled "Modeling Complete Distributions with Incomplete
    Observations: The Velocity Ellipsoid from Hipparcos Data" by
    D. W. Hogg, M. R. Blanton, S. T. Roweis, and K. V. Johnston ( MS#
    61222).

    Both myself and the referee are happy with your revisions, and at
    this stage I am close to accepting the paper.  First though, could
    I ask that you consider the minor comments provided by the referee
    below?

We have fixed up these last things too.

    When you resubmit the paper, please include a detailed cover
    letter containing the listing of the changes you've made to the
    text and your responses to the report.

    Processing of your revised manuscript will be expedited if you
    make your revisions to the manuscript latex file available for
    downloading from the ApJ Web Peer Review System
    (http://mss.uchicago.edu/ApJ/).  This version includes your
    previous submission plus any modifications to latex commands
    necessary for smooth processing by the ApJ electronic system.  The
    associated PDF file is the version seen by the referee.

    If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

    ApJ Review MS#61222

    TITLE: Modeling Complete Distributions with Incomplete Observations: 
    The Velocity Ellipsoid from Hipparcos Data

    AUTHORS: D. W. Hogg, M. R. Blanton, S. T. Roweis, and K. V. Johnston

    I carefully read the corrected manuscript and I am pleased with
    this revised version. The authors have significantly improved the
    readability of the paper.  Their explanation of the method and the
    discussion are concise and precise.

    All the major comments were fully taken into account.  I do not
    have any significant comment to add besides a few minor comments
    which are detailed below (mainly typos and references). Those
    comments are very minor comments and I do not need to see the
    paper again. I would recommend publication after a carefull
    reading of the manuscript to correct the remaining typos.

    > AMEX is dead, and we dropped it.  We also added fully spelled-out
    > names for everything, with references where possible.

    check references (actually the 2MASS one)  ...

Fixed!

    > We agree, but since it is a major confirmation of the methodology, we
    > still felt it merited mention.

    I would then add the comment that it confirms the methodology,
    just to make sure the reader gets your point.

Added the comment.

    > *exactly* the same input data, there are no known tests for deciding
    > what kinds of differences are statistically "significant", so we

    If you were using the exact same binning, the paired t-tested
    would apply I believe. Nevertheless, I do not think that Dehnen's
    binning in color can be exactly reproduced in which case this test
    would only give you a very crude estimate of the real significance
    level.

Fine, although we don't entirely agree about the t-test, since both
data sets are literally identical.

    There are quite a few typos left in the text (especially the annex
    1), please correct them.

Corrected all I could find -- which were indeed quite a few!
